<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>Introduction</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
      <h1>I am Changfeng</h1>

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am an international student from the PRC. I completed my high school education there. Then, I came to the US for my college education. I am a junior, majoring in Biological Science. When I was in high school, I felt that I was really good at Math and Physics and considered becoming a Data Analyst. However, in my second year at the University of Pittsburgh, I shifted my interests to Biology and pre-med. I am fascinated by the complexities of cells and their unique functions in controlling biological systems. Currently, I am taking courses like Genetics, Organic Chemistry 1, Integrative Writing and Design, etc. Hopefully, I can achieve good grades at the end of this semester.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I have no experience with coding, programming, or designing. Fortunately, during my freshman year, I took writing classes. This may be the thing that can help me. Generally speaking, this course will be a challenge for me. I consider myself a maker. Sometimes, I would use a video editor to edit pictures, mostly natural sceneries, and upload them on Douyin (Chinese TikTok). Through this course, I want to learn how basic design skills can be incorporated with writing and how to utilize Adobe InDesign skills.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>In my words, good design is a visual and experiential effect that makes consumers feel comfortable and bring up their desires. I don't have specific design interests. As long as the product looks good, I think it is a good design. What I think products with good-looking design have all kinds of styles, whether they are monotonous, complex, exaggerated or understated. For example, when I shop online, I will only be attracted and buy products with beautiful appearance compared to the practical value of the goods. The clothing colors can be vibrant and multicolored, but they can also be monochromatic.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here with examples of good design.-->

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After undergraduate education, I would like to enter medical school, get my M.D. degree, and complete the residency. Finally, I could be a physician. The reason why I want to be a doctor is that I can help patients regain hope in their vulnerable and desperate times. Besides, doctors' incomes are quite optimistic and stable. Although my parents have their own businesses, they discouraged me from following their paths. Compared with the high returns that come with high risks, being a doctor is a more stable and secure career. Additionally, my brother is a dental student studying in Japan. We often share our feelings and encourage each other over the phone. I believe the work we do in this space will strengthen my skills of research design in the future.</h3>
